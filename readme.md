# Create a file from input

**Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/js_task-guideline/blob/master/README.md) before start**

Implement an app that will create a file with a given name and content.

1) When the app is launched, ask the user to enter the file name.
  > Make sure provided file name is not an empty string.
2) When the file name is provided, ask to enter the content.
3) When the user completes interaction, your app must create a file and output `Success` or `Error` depending on the result of creation.
